    📊 Trade-Tariff Scatter Analysis

      <h4 style="margin:0 0 8px 0; color:#1a1a2e; font-size:0.95rem;">What This Shows</h4>
      <p style="margin:0; color:#4a5568; font-size:0.9rem; line-height:1.6;">Each bubble represents one of the top 500 imported products (HS10 codes). The <b>X-axis</b> (log scale) shows total trade value. The <b>Y-axis</b> shows average tariff rate. <b>Bubble size</b> also represents trade volume—bigger bubbles = more trade. <b>Color</b> indicates HS chapter for quick category identification.</p>

      <h4 style="margin:0 0 8px 0; color:#1a1a2e; font-size:0.95rem;">How to Use It</h4>
      <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:20px; color:#4a5568; font-size:0.9rem; line-height:1.8;">
        <li><b>Hover:</b> See product name, chapter, trade value, and tariff rate</li>
               <li><b>Click:</b> Click any bubble to see the full product description</li>
               <li><b>Zoom:</b> Drag to select a region; double-click to reset</li>
               <li><b>Quadrant analysis:</b> Upper-right = high trade + high tariff</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div style="background:linear-gradient(135deg, #ef444415 0%, #ef444408 100%); padding:16px; border-radius:12px; border:1px solid #ef444430;">
      <h4 style="margin:0 0 8px 0; color:#ef4444; font-size:0.95rem;">💡 Key Insights</h4>
      <p style="margin:0; color:#4a5568; font-size:0.9rem; line-height:1.6; font-style:italic;">Products in the upper-right quadrant (high trade value AND high tariff rate) contribute most to tariff revenue. These are the most impactful products for trade policy analysis. Lower-left products have minimal tariff impact due to either low volume, low rate, or both.</p>
