      <p style="margin:0; color:#4a5568; font-size:0.9rem; line-height:1.6;">A 100% stacked area chart showing how the top 15 HS chapters (2-digit product categories) contribute to total US imports each month. The vertical axis always sums to 100%, so you can see which sectors gained or lost market share over time. Each color band represents a different chapter.</p>

      <h4 style="margin:0 0 8px 0; color:#10b981; font-size:0.95rem;">💡 Key Insights</h4>
      <p style="margin:0; color:#4a5568; font-size:0.9rem; line-height:1.6; font-style:italic;">Electronics (Ch. 85) and Machinery (Ch. 84) consistently dominate US imports, together accounting for roughly 30-35% of total value. Look for share shifts following major tariff events—some categories may have seen import frontloading or diversion.</p>
